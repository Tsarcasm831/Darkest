# AGENTS

This project is a simple React demo that runs entirely in the browser.

## Guidelines
- Use 2 spaces for indentation in JavaScript and JSX files.
- Use ES module syntax (`import`/`export`) and function components with PascalCase
  names.
- No automated tests are available.

Programmatic checks are not required.
